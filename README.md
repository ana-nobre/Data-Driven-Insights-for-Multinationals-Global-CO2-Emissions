# üåç Data Insights: CO‚ÇÇ Emissions by Country, Region, and Sector   

## Introduction    

This project simulates a consultancy case at a **country-level granularity**. The analysis highlights how emissions differ across nations and regions, helping governments, international organizations, and multinational companies prioritize policies, investments, and ESG strategies.  

Climate change is not only an environmental challenge but also a strategic business and policy concern. Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions, as the main driver of global warming, directly impact economic stability, regulatory frameworks, corporate sustainability strategies, and long-term investment decisions.  

This project develops an **interactive dashboard in Tableau/Power BI** to track and analyze CO‚ÇÇ emissions by country, region, and sector. The goal is to provide decision-makers, analysts, and stakeholders with clear insights into emission trends, sectoral contributions, and global disparities.  

By leveraging this analysis, organizations and policymakers can benchmark performance, identify high-impact sectors, evaluate regional progress, and align strategies with global sustainability goals (e.g., Net Zero targets and ESG reporting).  

The dataset used comes from Kaggle:  
Dangi, S. (2024). *CO‚ÇÇ Emissions across Countries, Regions and Sectors*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshdangi/co-emissions-across-countries-regions-and-sectors

## üéØ Project Objectives  
- Provide a clear and visual overview of CO‚ÇÇ emissions at global and regional levels.  
- Identify **key sectors** responsible for the majority of emissions.  
- Detect **reduction patterns** in specific countries and regions.  
- Strengthen skills in **data analysis, advanced visualization, and data storytelling**.  
- Communicate findings in an **executive and decision-oriented** manner.

## üìä Key Analytical Questions  

This project aims to provide answers to the following research questions:  

1. **Which countries contribute the most and the least to global CO‚ÇÇ emissions?**  
2. **How are CO‚ÇÇ emissions distributed across continents and regions?**  
3. **What is the relationship between CO‚ÇÇ emissions and primary energy consumption across time and regions?**  
4. **How do CO‚ÇÇ emissions correlate with global temperature change over the years?**  
5. **How does Spain‚Äôs CO‚ÇÇ emissions trend compare with other regions in relation to temperature increase?**  
6. **What is the relationship between CO‚ÇÇ emissions and population, both at country and continental level?**

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology  

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Reviewed data quality, missing values, and outliers.  
- Identified critical metrics: total, per capita, accumulated, and sectoral emissions.  

**2. Data Transformation and Preparation**  
- Cleaned and normalized the dataset.  
- Created new calculated metrics (e.g., % sectoral contribution).  

**3. Visualization Design**  
- Geographic maps for country/region comparisons.  
- Time series for emission evolution.  
- Stacked bar and area charts for sectoral distribution.  
- Dynamic filters and intuitive navigation.  

**4. Interactive Dashboard Creation**  
- Minimalist design with accessible color palette.  
- Included **key KPIs**: global emissions since 1960, top 5 emitting countries, % by sector.  

**5. Scrum Methodology Applied**  
- Work divided into **weekly sprints** with clearly defined goals.  
- **Daily stand-ups** to track progress and remove blockers.  
- **Sprint reviews** at the end of each iteration, presenting the dashboard and gathering feedback.  
- **Sprint retrospectives** to continuously improve teamwork and workflow.  
- Agile task management tools were used to ensure transparency and accountability.

## üìå Key Insights 
- Over the past **20 years**, **China** has shown the fastest growth in emissions, driven by rapid industrial development and coal-based energy.  
- Several **European countries** (e.g., UK, Germany, France) demonstrate a **sustained reduction trend**, while **India and many Southeast Asian countries** continue to grow rapidly.  
- **Per capita emissions** reveal strong inequalities: some **small, oil-rich states** (Qatar, Kuwait, UAE) exceed the levels of large emerging economies like **India or Brazil**, despite their much smaller populations.
